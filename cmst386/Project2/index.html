            Project 2 - The Proposal
        </h1>

    <section>
        <h2>
            Client and Topic
        </h2>
        <p>The proposed website, SkillSwap, is the platform aimed to describe and promote a mobile application of the
            same
            name – whose goal is to facilitate the exchange of services via a swipe-based system. It could be seen as a
            build for a home-based business, as this is a passion project of my own creation. </p>
        <h2>
            Development Process and Engagement
        </h2>
        <p>The website isn’t being developed for a specific client, however, I will conduct my research to create the
            content for this site. That includes looking at specific websites that operate through similar methods like
            dating application websites as they operate on a swipe-based discovery model. It also includes extensive
            research on into any platform that may or may not be offering similar services. Furthermore, I will research
            and
            develop my site (to the best of my abilities thus far in my coding career) based on user preferences,
            current
            and emerging trends in web development, UI/UX best practices, and other new information gathered along the
            way.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Testing
        </h2>
        <p>
            To ensure that my website operates free from error and as designed, I’ll conduct usability testing amongst
            my
            peers. I will also employ responsive design testing by using mobile devices that are available to me through
            my
            peers such as a Samsung Galaxy and different iPhone models, desktop devices, and common browsers such as
            Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Description
        </h2>
        <p>
            The SkillSwap application has one goal in mind: to leverage the underutilized skills and talents of people
            within a community to connect and help one another in a way that doesn’t focus on monetary exchange.
            Instead,
            users will swipe, and form connections based on the skills that they need in order to complete a task in
            exchange for the skills and services they provide, forming an ecosystem where everybody can contribute,
            benefit,
            and empower their local communities. The website itself will serve as the central hub for users and other
            interested parties. This is where they will go to understand the concept of the application, learn more
            about me
            and my personal values, the mission of the company, catch up with the latest updates, contact me, and
            discover
            how the application works.
            The target audience is broad – but I can assume that it will appeal greatly to hobbyists, students, and even
            retirees. At the end of the day though, I want SkillSwap to be an inclusive place for anybody who has a
            talent/passion/skill that they wish to share. It’s about putting trade back into the hands of the people and
            about fostering stronger communities.

        <h2>
            Growth and Maintenance
        </h2>
        <p>
            The SkillSwap companion website is designed to be an informational resource to the application; however, it
            must
            grow and evolve with any content or design changes to the application so it may be reflective. Potential
            expansions could be a blog to keep users informed or testimonials to encourage user-growth.
            Maintenance tasks would mainly include checking and fixing broken links, testing site speed, and SEO
            optimization. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind evolving and growing accessibility
            standards/guidelines. I would like to complete all of these checks on a monthly basis.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Organization
        </h2>
        <p>
            The website will be designed to be intuitive and easy-to-use with a clear navigation bar at the top with
            tabs
            that have been laid out for “Home”, “About”, “How it Works”, “Our Team”, “Contact Us” and “Get Started For
            Free!”. Beneath About will be a dropdown menu for “Mission”, and “Blog/News”. The homepage will be a quick
            overview of what the app is along with an additional call-to-action card to download the application. The
            “Mission” page will detail the mission statement and vision along with further details and photos of the
            application (for now they will most likely be prototyped rough drafts). The “Blog/News” will be for regular
            updates regarding the development of the application and testimonials from users. The “How it Works” page
            will
            detail more specific processes and a how-to guide for using the application. The “Our Team” section will
            primarily focus on myself, my background, and why I wanted to create the application. The “Contact Us”
            section
            will have forms for getting in touch with me for any questions, comments, recommendations, or concerns. The
            “Get
            Started For Free” will lead to a page that prompts the user to download the app through the iOS app store or
            Google Play (which will not be functional for the purposes of this project as I do not have the application
            developed yet).
            In my footer, I will have links to Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, and FAQs.
            Prior to developing the website, I will create wireframes and mockups to ensure that the website is laid out
            in a way that is easy to navigate and understand. I will also create a sitemap to ensure that the website is
            organized in a way that makes sense and is easy to navigate.

        <h2>
            Security
        </h2>
        <p>
            I’m still researching what security features need to be standard for this website build, but when I launch
            the
            website there are five main components that I will look at:
        <ol>
            <li>Using a secure HTTPS to encrypt the data sent between the user and the server. </li>
            <li>Updates will happen frequently to ensure that the platform and any plugins are up-to-date to lower the
                chances of security vulnerabilities that happen with outdated software.</li>
            <li>CAPTCHAs for contact forms to protect against bots or scammers. </li>
            <li>When I launch the website, I will choose a reputable and secure hosting provider.</li>
            <li>Firewall protection against possible attacks.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Web Hosting</h2>
        <p>A few key criteria will need to be used to select a web host.
        <ol>
            <li>Selecting a hosting company that has a good reputation for uptime and site infrastructure, so that users
                can
                visit the website around the clock.</li>
            <li>High bandwidth and storage in order to meet the demands of high website traffic and the ability to
                support
                the content on the website.</li>
            <li>While users will not be prompted to log in to the application via the website, there may be
                functionality at
                some point to manage their account settings so the host should offer firewall protection and SSL
                technology
                to protect and encrypt their data.</li>
            <li>Counting on traffic growth, I would prefer to choose a hosting service that is flexible and scalable.
            </li>
            <li>Solid customer support reputation to address any issues that I run into.</li>
            <li>Finally, price. If all other criteria are met, I want to find a host that offers competitive, fair, and
                transparent pricing amongst their competitors.</li>
        </ol>
        As far as technology goes, I will need an SSL Certificate, HTML/CSS, and Javascript, and I will consider using
        APIs
        and plugins to enhance the website by providing robust accessibility options and a chat window for customer
        support.
        I want the domain name to be instantly recognizable to match the branding of the application. Searches,
        unfortunately lead me to realize that skillswap.com was taken, but www.skill-swap-app.com is available and I
        think
        it is a good alternative. It is simple, easy to remember, and clearly defines what the website is for.
        </p>

        <h2>Marketing</h2>
        <p>I primarily want to focus on digital marketing as I roll out the application, prompting people to visit the
            website for more information. However, the impetus is doing a test in my local community – so a large amount
            of
            verbal communication to cohorts will take place. In the end though, I’ve learned that there is interest in
            an
            application like this (a friend sent me a viral TikTok regarding the same concept which asked for an
            application
            literally just like this), so I’m thinking of starting a digital campaign where I garner interest and gain
            followers alongside the build process – providing them with regular updates and progression so that
            hopefully
            I’ll have gained some traction when it is time to launch.
            SEO will be optimized by using appropriate meta tags, alt tags, and site maps.
