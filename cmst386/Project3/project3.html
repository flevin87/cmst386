        <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
        <p>Responsive design ensures that website layouts adjust in a dynamic way, responding to both screen size and
            orientation. This is crucial when developing content because users consume web content in significantly
            different ways, be it a smartphone, desktop, tablet, or laptop. By developing with responsive design in
            mind, the developer is able to significantly improve user experiences, increase engagement, and boost
            consumer retention and conversion. </p>
