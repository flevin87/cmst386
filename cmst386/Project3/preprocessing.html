    <!-- I implemented SASS by downloading Node.JS and then using the command line command "npm install -g sass"
    Utilizing the NodeJS library allows me to write all of my styles in the main.scss and as long as I tell VSCode to "Watch SASS", the styles I write will be compiled and converted into CSS that the browser is able to understand.-->

            <h2>Preprocessing</h2>
            <p>Preprocessing can be implemented via the client or the server. For client-side preprocessing, you need to
                compile your preprocessed code like SASS into CSS in the user's browser using Javascript. Server-side
                however, is done before the website is sent to the user's browser by using a task runner to "watch" your
                changes in Sass or Less then compile them into CSS. The latter is more efficient, as it reduces load on
                the
                user's browser and also allows the SASS based CSS to still appear in the browser if that user has
                Javascript
                disabled.</p>
        </section>
        <div class="subContentHeader">
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>SASS keeps styles clean, organized, and efficient with its wealth of features that help cut down on
                tedious
                code.
            </p>
            <div class="subContentMain">
                <section class="flex-left">
                    <p><span>Variables:</span>SASS allows you to declare variables to cut down on excessive time spent
                        changing
                        each
                        element's style one by one. Say that you use a specific color a lot on your page. With SASS, you
                        can
                        initialize the variable and assign it a specific value, and then call to that variable each time
                        you
                        wish to
                        use it.</p>
                    <p><span>Nesting:</span> this allows you to condense many different elements and their property
                        value
                        pairs
                        under one roof. This is a convenient and clean way to organize your content, so that it is easy
                        to
                        identify,
                        modify, and organize all the different elements you may be working with.</p>
                    <p><span>Separate and Import:</span> as your stylesheets grow, you may wish that you could work on
                        certain
                        elements in a different file. With SASS, you are able to do just that by creating another file
                        and
                        then
                        using @import to bring that work back into your styles. This further aids in the organization of
                        your
                        code.
                    </p>

                <section class="flex-right">
                    <p><span>Mixins: </span>Mixins are reusable chunks of code in SASS. They allow you to define
                        specific
                        styles
                        that can be reused multiple times throughout your stylesheets without having to remember and
                        rewrite
                        all
                        of
                        the details. Values can also be passed into them for further customization and flexibility.</p>
                    <p><span>Operators: </span>SASS supports standard math operators which can be incredibly helpful
                        when
                        calculating things like widths, heights, margins, paddings, and other CSS size-related
                        properties.
                    </p>
                    <p><span>Functions: </span>Like in Javascript, SASS includes customizable functions that allow you
                        to
                        define
                        complex operations that can be reused throughout your code to manipulate things like color,
                        sizes,
                        strings,
                        lists, and more.</p>
