                <summary>How Does Skill Swap Work?</summary>
                <p>Skill Swap is an online platform that allows users to trade their unique skill sets with other users'
                    skills in order to complete services for one another. Skill Swap works intuitevly by allowing you to
                    swipe on user profiles in a stack based upon your needs. When two users have swiped right on one
                    another, a connection is made and the users are notified. From there, users are able to discuss
                    their needs and make a deal. </p>
