            <p class="blog-text">There is a long way to go. However, I've finished my first draft for a hi-fidelity
                wireframe and prototyped it to demonstrate functionality of the application. Follow along to see this
                prototype evolve as it receives further development and iterations.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-header">The beginning</h2>
            <p class="blog-text">This idea came to me doing something very simple. I made an offer to a coworker to help
                design and build a website when I felt confident enough because he offered to trim my trees in my front
                yard. He offered this for free as he doesn't value money the same way that a lot of people tend to. This
                got me thinking about the potential of bringing back bartering in a way that was easy to access and
                simple to engage with. I discussed this idea with some friends and family, and eventually somebody sent
                me a TikTok which posed the question, "why doesn't an app like this exist yet", and I knew from there
                that developing this platform was something I wanted to do. I did not consider myself a professional
                coder, by any means, but I am fully committed to learning everything it takes to build this from the
                ground up.</p>
