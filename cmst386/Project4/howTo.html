                <h2>The Chef</h2>
                <p>Kimberly, a creative city-based chef, renowned for her innovative gourmet dishes, desires to elevate
                    her restaurant with home-grown ingredients. However, her gardening skills aren't on par with her
                    culinary expertise, hindering her farm-to-table aspirations.</p>

            <div class="column">
                <img src="images/farmer.jpg" alt="Ciera the Green Thumb" class="profile-image">
                <h2>The Green Thumb</h2>
                <p>Ciera, a wine representative, links local venues with fine natural wines and personally grows unique
                    produce and raises quail. She's planning a sophisticated wine-food pairing event, and is in need of
                    a talented chef to prepare a menu that highlights her wine and homegrown offerings.</p>

            <h2>Using the App: A Scenario</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Kimberly, an innovative city-based chef, creates her profile on Skill Swap, showcasing her culinary
                    skills and her need for home gardening expertise.</li>
                <li>Similarly, Ciera, a wine representative and amateur gardener, sets up her profile highlighting her
                    fine wine selection, unique homegrown produce, and her need for a professional chef's touch for an
                    upcoming event.</li>
                <li>They both use the swipe function to explore profiles. One day, Kimberly comes across Ciera's profile
                    and is intrigued by her homegrown produce. She swipes right. On the same day, Ciera also swipes
                    right on Kimberly's profile, impressed by her culinary skills.</li>
                <li>A match is made! Kimberly and Ciera can now chat with each other through the app.</li>
                <li>They discuss their needs and agree on a skill swap. Kimberly will cook for Ciera's event using
                    Ciera's homegrown produce, and in exchange, Ciera will help Kimberly start a garden for her
                    restaurant. A win-win situation without any money exchanged!</li>
