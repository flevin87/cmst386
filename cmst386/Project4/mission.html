            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>Our mission at SkillSwap is to create a vibrant, global community where skills are the currency. We
                strive to empower individuals to discover, share, and exchange their unique abilities in a way that
                encourages learning, fosters connections, and promotes a more sustainable and inclusive economy. We
                believe that everyone has something valuable to offer and that every transaction doesn't have to be
                monetary. By transforming how we value and exchange skills, we aim to redefine the meaning of wealth and
                success.</p>
