        <h1>Search Engines</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Search engines use complex algorithms to crawl, index, and rank web pages based on relevance, quality, and user
        experience. By employing SEO best practices such as proper keyword use, quality content, site performance/speed,
        and proper link building, search engines are able to higher rank web pages and improve a site's visibility in
        search engine results.</p>
    <h3>The Importance of Key Words</h3>
    <p>Key Words are integral to SEO because they are a part of the relationship between the content one's website
        offers and the content that users search for. Due to the nature of search engines, smaller databases are
        responsible for storing keyword-based indexes - thus a developer should choose their keywords based on relevancy
        and where they wish to be ranked. The goal is to rank highly for keywords that you believe people are searching
        for when they want what your website provides.</p>
    <h3>Meta Tag Descriptions</h3>
    <p>A meta tag description is a brief summary of a website's content, and it appears below the title on a search
        engine results page. While this description doesn't affect rankings, it is important to choose an effective
        description, often using your keyword, to boost traffic and conversions - which will influence your rankings.
    </p>
    <h3>Four Elements of Creating Relevant Content Links</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Anchor Text: The clickable text in a hyperlink must be relevant to the page that you are linking to. </li>
        <li>Quality Links: Each link should direct the user to high-quality, dependable, and relevant resources.</li>
        <li>Relevancy: The linked content should always be closely related to the content on your own website. This
            helps search engines understand the relationship between separate pieces of content.</li>
        <li>Quantity: As a developer, one should not make their content to be spammy - try to balance this out by having
            a reasonable number of high-quality links.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Understanding Hierarchy</h3>
    <p> A well established hierarchy is a vital part of readability for users and SEO. It organizes your content
        logically based off of importance and relevance, which helps users and search engines understand the
        relationship between content and the structure of your page. Below is an example of a hierarchy in action from a
        recent article on <a
            href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768463/nintendo-direct-june-2023-announcements-trailers-news">The
            Verge</a> (Note: I have lowered each item by one level to demonstrate the hierarchy in action without
        compromising the hierarchy of my own page).
    </p>
    <h2>The 5 biggest announcements from the June 2023 Nintendo direct </h2>
    <p>The h1 is used here to describe the main content on the page</p>
    <h3>Mario's big year continues with a new side scroller and a remake</h3>
    <p>The h2 here was used as a subheader to further organize the content that we were about to see</p>
    <h4>A new side-scrolling Super Mario Game</h4>
    <p>This h3 continues to break up the content and is used to introduce its own subset of content. Following the h3 in
        the original article is a paragraph talking about the new game
        This can continue all the way until h6, but most content won't require that depth of visual hierarchy. </p>
